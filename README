Pre-requisites
	Powershell version 5.0 or above should be available.
	Powershell script execution permission should be there.
	All required component,component instance is created on appsone ui
	Required KPI is added to component.

Configuration
 
    The KPI name will be configurable in Config.ps1.
	Component Name will be user defined and should be provided in Config.ps1.
    Component Instance Name, Remote IP and Remote Port will be configurable in Config.ps1 as colon separated values and entering correct values would be user's responsibility.ex: $DEATAILS[0] = "MyComponentInstanceName:10.1.1.170:25"
	$DEATAILS[1] = "MyComponentInstanceName:10.1.1.175:25"
    
	If any field IP:Port pair is blank, the script would ignore the entry.
    If Component Instance name is not given, then it could will be default value, i.e. baseIP(from where the script runs)_remoteIP(the IP we are monitoring)_remotePort and it will be created dynamically by the script. Ex: 10_1_1_174_25. But it has to be created in the same name at A1 UI, otherwise it won't be captured.
   

	
Usage

	.\Windows_MountPoint_Monitoring.ps1 -h [Display help message]
